# Immaculate Innings Paper
This is the repository of my Research Methodology Final Paper

SPM 295 Research Methodology is a course offered by Syracuse University that I completed in Fall of 2020. This was my final project. We were given loose guidelines 
to research a topic of our choosing and apply one of the research methods that we learned in the course. For my project I chose to build upon the concept of Monte 
Carlo Simulations that we covered in the course. I chose to apply it to a general research question of how common is an immaculate inning in baseball. Because of 
the time frame of the project, I was not able to extrapolate my process to a significant sample. Instead the focuse of this paper was merely to build and develop a 
methodolgy of how to simulate pitch by pitch outcomes using common stats like a pitcher's in-zone/out-of-zone strike percentages, swing rates, and contact rates. 
Therefore the methodology was only applied to one pitcher: Edwin Diaz. 

All of the project code was written in R and it is listed and entitled PrestonFinalProject.R. A PDF of the paper is also listed and entitled
